Cloud refers to the software and services that run on the Internet, instead of locally on your computer. Today, the very websites
you visit, the photos you take on your phone, the data you access to register for courses or to buy those household items online
is likely stored in “the Cloud.” No, the Cloud is not a group of fluffy cumulous shapes in the sky.

The Cloud is composed of a network of servers that compose the internet. Fortune 500 companies across the United States and
globally are investing billions of dollars to adopt Cloud platforms as part of their digital transformation. In fact, Gartner, the world’s
leading research and advisory company, forecasts that global spend for Cloud in 2021 will exceed $308 billion dollars. This
growth is eclipsed by the lack of Cloud talent in industry.  The Ivy Tech Cloud Technologies program is dedicated to provide
students with the skills required to meet the growing demand for Cloud talent. Students will develop foundational skills in system
administration that will translate to a wide variety of business scenarios.

Our graduates are skilled in developing and maintaining multi-user computer systems for business, from small organizations to
large enterprises. Students will learn how to unpack complex problems and systems and learn how modern organizations are
dealing with ever changing infrastructure. Students will learn about popular Cloud platforms such as Amazon Web Services
(AWS) and Microsoft Azure.

Additionally, as a Cloud Technologies major you have the opportunity to earn the CompTIA A+, Security+, and Network+, A Cloud
Practitioner, and AWS Solutions Architect certifications. These certifications are currency to help you land a great job in Cloud
while being exposed to groundbreaking technologies, attacking the issues facing Fortune 500 companies and small businesses
alike.
